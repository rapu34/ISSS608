By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:\n\n-   control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package,\n\n-   create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages,\n\n-   plot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.\n\n## **2.2 Getting started**\n\n### **2.2.1 Installing and loading the required libraries**\n\nIn this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:\n\n-   ggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.\n\n-   ggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’.\n\n-   hrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.\n\n-   patchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.\n\nCode chunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto your working R environment.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, \n               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,\n               tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### **2.2.2 Importing data**\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, a data file called *Exam_data* will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.\n\nThe code chunk below imports *exam_data.csv* into R environment by using [*read_csv()*](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package. **readr** is one of the tidyverse package.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexam_data <- read.csv(\"/Users/jay/ISSS608-VAA/Hands-on_Ex/Hands_on_Ex02/Exam_data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThere are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.\n\n-   The categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.\n\n-   The continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.\n\n## **2.3 Beyond ggplot2 Annotation: ggrepel**\n\nOne of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## The plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n[**ggrepel**](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/) ![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap02/img/image3.jpg){width=\"32\" height=\"36\"} is an extension of **ggplot2** package which provides `geoms` for **ggplot2** to repel overlapping text as in our examples on the right.\n\n![](images/clipboard-1606093262.png)\n\nWe simply replace `geom_text()` by [`geom_text_repel()`](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/reference/geom_text_repel.html) and `geom_label()`by [`geom_label_repel`](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/reference/geom_text_repel.html).\n",
