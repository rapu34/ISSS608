# **2  Beyond ggplot2 Fundamentals**

## **2.1 Overview**

In this chapter, you will be introduced to several ggplot2 extensions for creating more elegant and effective statistical graphics. By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

-   control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package,

-   create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages,

-   plot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.

## **2.2 Getting started**

### **2.2.1 Installing and loading the required libraries**

In this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:

-   ggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.

-   ggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’.

-   hrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.

-   patchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.

Code chunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto your working R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, 
               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,
               tidyverse)
```

### **2.2.2 Importing data**

For the purpose of this exercise, a data file called *Exam_data* will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.

The code chunk below imports *exam_data.csv* into R environment by using [*read_csv()*](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package. **readr** is one of the tidyverse package.

```{r}
exam_data <- read.csv("/Users/jay/ISSS608-VAA/Hands-on_Ex/Hands_on_Ex02/Exam_data.csv")
```

There are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.

-   The categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.

-   The continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.

## **2.3 Beyond ggplot2 Annotation: ggrepel**

One of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.

## The Code

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              size=0.5) +  
  geom_label(aes(label = ID), 
             hjust = .5, 
             vjust = -.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3")
```

## The plot

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: false
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              size=0.5) + 
  geom_label(aes(label = ID), 
             hjust = .5, 
             vjust = -.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3")
```

[**ggrepel**](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/) ![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap02/img/image3.jpg){width="32" height="36"} is an extension of **ggplot2** package which provides `geoms` for **ggplot2** to repel overlapping text as in our examples on the right.

![](images/clipboard-1606093262.png)

We simply replace `geom_text()` by [`geom_text_repel()`](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/reference/geom_text_repel.html) and `geom_label()`by [`geom_label_repel`](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/reference/geom_text_repel.html).
